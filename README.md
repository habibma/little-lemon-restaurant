<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<h3>The project’s goal was to create a web app for a given restaurant. These steps were taken:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Defining Persona and Determining Customer Journet Map</li>
<li>Wireframing pages</li>
<li>Designing Components in Figma according to the Brand UI Kit</li>
<li>Designing a high-fidelity prototype before developing the process</li>
<li>Developing web applications with React technology</li>
</ul>
React is a popular library of JavaScript that allows us to design a website with the SPA (Single Page Application) approach that makes the output a fast app.

I used Git and GitHub during the project development. Git enables developers to work simultaneously on one project and track everything happening in every upgrading step.

This project has been accepted as a successful final project in the course named: “<a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/C97W7M5D4G8S" target="_blank">Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate</a>.”
